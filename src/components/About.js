				I am working at Moon Lab, a company that powers up institutions (Fintech
				and Banking) with our enterprise-grade blockchain and DLT solutions.
				Moon Lab focuses on several use cases where it makes sense to use
				blockchain technology, such as, Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization,
				digital identity and KYC verification, TradeFi, Purpose Bound Money
				(PBM), stablecoin, digital wallet and many more. I am excited to
				connect, explore, and collaborate together with people from various
				backgrounds to make blockchain technology massively adopted.
